# ðŸŽ¯ Final Steps Before Deployment

## âœ… What's Complete

- âœ… Waitlist form with Google Sheets integration
- âœ… Production build ready
- âœ… Code on GitHub (https://github.com/squirtgunhero/node3-waitlist)
- âœ… Legal disclaimers added
- âœ… Privacy Policy page (working modal)
- âœ… Terms of Service page (working modal)
- âœ… Footer with all legal links

## ðŸ”§ Last Thing: Update Contact Email

Currently, the contact email is set to: `contact@node-3.com`

This appears in 3 places:
1. Footer link (line 186 in `src/App.tsx`)
2. Privacy Policy (line 94 in `src/components/PrivacyPolicy.tsx`)
3. Terms of Service (line 144 in `src/components/TermsOfService.tsx`)

### Option 1: Keep contact@node-3.com
If you have this email set up, you're good to go!

### Option 2: Use Different Email
Tell me your preferred email and I'll update all 3 files.

### Option 3: Update Later
You can deploy now and update the email later.
