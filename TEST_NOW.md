# ‚úÖ Your Google Sheets Integration is READY!

## Configuration Complete ‚úì

Your `.env` file has been created with your Google Apps Script URL:
```
https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbw0S91ZisngpJQCmnqZ1RHQcvO6gXf2UY3kNCUg6jkmJPXAvfFV2PyzHJuhtrH_4xUI/exec
```

## About That "doGet" Error

The error you saw when visiting the URL in your browser is **NORMAL and EXPECTED**. 

- ‚ùå Browser visits use GET requests ‚Üí Shows error (security feature)
- ‚úÖ Form submissions use POST requests ‚Üí Works perfectly

This means your script is deployed correctly and secured!
